It achieves this by accessing SQLite databases (e.g., `Login Data`, `Cookies`) within browser profiles.\n    *   **Cryptocurrency Wallet Data**: It specifically targets and zips up data from Atomic Wallet, Exodus Wallet, and potentially others, along with Steam configuration files, indicating an attempt to steal cryptocurrency and gaming credentials.\n    *   **General Sensitive Files**: It searches the user's Desktop, Downloads, and Documents folders for files and directories containing keywords like \""account,\"" \""password,\"" \""secret,\"" \""metamask,\"" \""wallet,\"" \""crypto,\"" \""token,\"" and \""backup.\"" Any matching files are then uploaded.\n    *   **IP Address**: It retrieves the public IP address of the infected machine.\n\n*   **Data Exfiltration**: The collected sensitive data is exfiltrated to external locations:\n    *   **Discord Webhook**: A hardcoded Discord webhook URL (`https://discord.com/api/webhooks/1107179782954827816/vZiZEw-nL0d5AewU8h6aqHugdcp0ZEkxs8COOiUKEMgkGRzIx-m4oToqecroQZa3g1OI`) is extensively used to send detailed user information, browser credentials, and other stolen data in JSON format.\n    *   **File Hosting Service (transfer.sh)**: It uploads discovered \""interesting files\"" from the user's common directories (Desktop, Downloads, Documents) to `https://transfer.sh/`, a legitimate file-sharing service often abused by malware for data exfiltration.\n\n*   **Credential Decryption**: The script utilizes Windows' Data Protection API (DPAPI) via `ctypes` and `windll.crypt32.CryptUnprotectData`, along with AES decryption from `Crypto.Cipher.AES`, to decrypt sensitive data such as browser passwords and Discord tokens, which are typically stored encrypted.\n\n*   **Process Manipulation**: It attempts to terminate processes (e.g., `opera.exe`, `chrome.exe`, `brave.exe`, `yandex.exe`, `edge.exe`, `Atomic Wallet.exe`, `Exodus.exe`, `steam.exe`, `NationsGlory.exe`) before zipping their related data, likely to ensure files are not in use and can be copied successfully.\n\n*   **Dependency Installation**: The script ensures its malicious operations can proceed by attempting to install necessary Python libraries (`requests` and `pycryptodome`) if they are not already present, using `subprocess.Popen(f\""{executable} -m pip install {modl[1]}\"",shell=True)`.\n\n*   **Obfuscation/Anti-analysis (Minor)**: While not heavily obfuscated, the `exec('')` at the beginning is unusual, and the `Trust` function with `len(tim)<-1` appears to be a flawed or non-functional attempt at an anti-analysis check, which thankfully does not prevent its malicious execution in this version.\n\n*   **File System Interaction**: It creates temporary files (`wppassw.txt`, `wpcook.txt`) in the user's `TEMP` directory to store stolen data before uploading.\n\nIn summary, `n1trobrdr` is a sophisticated information stealer designed to compromise a user's digital accounts and sensitive files."", ""num_of_python_files"": 1, ""package_description"": ""NA"", ""available_python_files"": [""setup.py""], ""package_formatted_path"": "".temp/plain/2023-05-14-n1trobrdr-v1.0_dump.json"", ""gemini_parsed_classification"": ""malicious"", ""gemini_parsed_suspicious_files"": [""setup.py"", ""wppassw.txt"", ""wpcook.txt""]}",,malicious,"The package is designed to steal sensitive user data, including Discord tokens, browser passwords, cryptocurrency wallet data, and general sensitive files.

While the decoded code itself contains syntax errors, the intent is clear: to run hidden code during the package installation.

It defines the package metadata, dependencies (`pyobjc-core`, `pyobjc-framework-Cocoa`), and an extension module written in Objective-C (`_Contacts.m`).

Its functions are related to:\n    *   **Build System Customization:** Overriding `setuptools` commands (e.g., `build_ext`, `test`) to handle macOS-specific build requirements (compiler flags, SDK paths, header file inclusion).\n    *   **Environment Checks:** Functions like `get_os_level`, `get_sdk`, and `_fixup_compiler` are used to determine the macOS version, SDK, and ensure a compatible compiler is used. These are crucial for building C/Objective-C extensions on different macOS environments.\n    *   **Testing Infrastructure:** The `oc_test` class provides custom logic for running tests, including managing `sys.path` and reporting test results.\n    *   **Metadata Enrichment:** The `oc_egg_info` class adds standard project URLs (documentation, issue tracker, repository) to the package metadata.\n\n4.  **No Suspicious Behavior:** There is no evidence of malicious activities such as:\n    *   Obfuscated or encrypted code.\n    *   Unusual imports or attempts to interact with sensitive system resources (e.g., `/etc/passwd`, SSH keys) beyond what's required for building and installing the package.\n    *   Network communication to unknown hosts.\n    *   Execution of arbitrary shell commands unrelated to the build process.\n    *   Installation of backdoors or persistence mechanisms.\n\n5.  **Consistent Metadata:** The author information, email, and homepage listed in the metadata are consistent with the `pyobjc` project, which is a legitimate and widely used library for bridging Python and Objective-C.\n\nIn conclusion, the package's code and its associated setup scripts exhibit characteristics typical of a well-behaved, legitimate Python package that provides bindings to a system-level framework on macOS."", ""num_of_python_files"": 25, ""package_description"": ""NA"", ""available_python_files"": [""pyobjc_setup.py"", ""setup.py"", ""print-contacts.py"", ""test_cngroup.py"", ""test_cncontact.py"", ""test_cncontactrelation.py"", ""test_cnsocialprofile.py"", ""test_cncontactsstore.py"", ""test_cnphonenumber.py"", ""test_cnchangehistoryfetchrequest.py"", ""test_cncontactfetchrequest.py"", ""test_contacts.py"", ""test_cnchangehistoryevent.py"", ""test_cncontainer.py"", ""test_cncontactstore.py"", ""test_cncontactformatter.py"", ""test_cnpostaladdressformatter.py"", ""test_cninstantmessageaddress.py"", ""__init__.py"", ""test_cnerror.py"", ""test_cnpostaladdress.py"", ""test_cnlabeledvalue.py"", ""test_cnsaverequest.py"", ""test_cncontactvcardserialization.py"", ""_metadata.py""], ""package_formatted_path"": "".temp/plain/pyobjc-framework-Contacts-8.5_dump.json"", ""gemini_parsed_classification"": ""benign"", ""gemini_parsed_suspicious_files"": []}",,benign,"The `pyobjc-framework-Contacts` package appears to be benign due to its standard package structure, purpose alignment with its name and description, analysis of the `pyobjc_setup.py` file showing no suspicious behavior, and consistent metadata with the legitimate `pyobjc` project.",{},2025-06-30 08:40:25.673462+00,2025-06-30 08:40:25.673462+00,c85254c9-0ebe-4a89-932a-cfd780558ea6,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,5d2dbc4b-3fe4-4673-9a97-4178ce62e773,8a178499-74d4-458a-a975-ec09a39a0159

This is a common practice for performance-critical operations or when integrating with system-level functionalities.\n\nThe `__init__.py` file reveals the core of the backporting mechanism.

Smith`, `njs@pobox.com`) correspond to a known Python developer, which adds credibility.\n    *   The `url` points to a legitimate GitHub repository: `https://github.com/python-trio/async_generator`.\n    *   The most notable line is `exec(open(\""async_generator/_version.py\"", encoding=\""utf-8\"").read())`. While `exec()` can be a security risk if used with untrusted input, in this context, it's used to read and execute the content of a local file (`_version.py`) to get the package version. This is a common, though sometimes discouraged, practice in Python packaging.\n\n2.  **`_version.py` and `__init__.py` analysis**:\n    *   The `get_python_script` tool returned empty content for both `_version.py` and `__init__.py`. If `_version.py` is genuinely empty, the `setup.py` script would likely fail due to `__version__` not being defined, making the package un-installable or broken. However, a broken package is not synonymous with a malicious one; it merely indicates a packaging issue.\n    *   Given the package's reported version (1.10) and the likelihood that it is a published, functional package, it's more probable that `_version.py` *does* contain the version information in a real-world scenario, and the empty output might be an anomaly in the retrieval process or the specific state of the file in the provided package location.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n\nBased on the content of `setup.py`, which adheres to standard packaging practices, the legitimate author information, and a valid GitHub repository URL, there are no immediate signs of malicious intent. The use of `exec()` for reading a local version file, while something to note, is a known (if imperfect) pattern and not inherently malicious, especially when the target file is expected to be benign and part of the same package.

These are typically used in `setup.py` files for package management, environment checks, and building extensions.\n*   **Safe Code Evaluation**: The `_package_data` function uses `ast.literal_eval` to safely parse data from the `__init__.py` file. This function is designed to only evaluate Python literal structures (strings, numbers, tuples, lists, dicts, booleans, and None), preventing the execution of arbitrary or malicious code.\n*   **C Extension Handling**: The `ext_modules` property includes logic for compiling and testing C extensions. This involves creating temporary C files and using `distutils.ccompiler` to check for compiler availability. This is a legitimate practice for packages that include compiled components.\n*   **Conditional Installation with `subprocess`**: The `main` function contains a `subprocess.check_output` call for installing \""pre-installable\"" packages (those marked with `*` in `install_requires`). While `subprocess` calls can be a vector for malicious activity, in this context, the list of packages to install (`install_pre`) is derived from the `_package_data` dictionary. Since the `__init__.py` file (the source of `_package_data`) is empty, no external malicious packages would be triggered for installation by default.\n*   **No Obvious Malicious Intent**: There is no code related to network communication for data exfiltration, unusual file system manipulation outside of standard installation paths, or attempts to establish persistence. The complexity arises from handling different Python versions, namespace packaging, and C extensions.\n\nIn conclusion, the sophisticated nature of the `setup.py` script is primarily due to its role in managing a robust Python package with C extensions and cross-version compatibility. The mechanisms that *could* be exploited for malicious purposes rely on external configuration (namely, a populated `__init__.py`), which is currently empty."", ""num_of_python_files"": 2, ""package_description"": ""NA"", ""available_python_files"": [""__init__.py"", ""setup.py""], ""package_formatted_path"": "".temp/plain/ruamel.yaml.clib-0.2.6_dump.json"", ""gemini_parsed_classification"": ""benign"", ""gemini_parsed_suspicious_files"": [""setup.py""]}",,benign,"The package `ruamel.yaml.clib` appears to be benign as the `setup.py` file focuses on standard package setup and installation processes, uses safe code evaluation, handles C extensions legitimately, and shows no obvious malicious intent.",{setup.py},2025-06-30 11:35:06.407216+00,2025-06-30 11:35:06.407216+00,c85254c9-0ebe-4a89-932a-cfd780558ea6,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,0ac2fb3f-cd85-444d-bda1-05162307d500,8a178499-74d4-458a-a975-ec09a39a0159

It uses `mypy.api.run` to execute mypy, processes its output, and integrates the results into the pytest reporting mechanism. It handles options like `--mypy-ignore-missing-imports` and `--mypy-config-file`. It also manages a temporary file for caching mypy results across test runs, especially when `pytest-xdist` is used, utilizing `filelock` for safe concurrent access. All operations, including file I/O and process execution, are directly related to the plugin's function of running mypy checks.\n\nOverall, the code is transparent, well-commented, and implements functionalities consistent with its stated purpose as a \""Mypy static type checker plugin for Pytest.\"" There are no signs of malicious activities such as obfuscation, unusual system calls, or attempts to compromise the user's system or data."", ""num_of_python_files"": 4, ""package_description"": ""pytest-mypy"", ""available_python_files"": [""setup.py"", ""test_pytest_mypy.py"", ""conftest.py"", ""pytest_mypy.py""], ""package_formatted_path"": "".temp/plain/pytest-mypy-0.9.1_dump.json"", ""gemini_parsed_classification"": ""benign"", ""gemini_parsed_suspicious_files"": []}",,benign,"The package `pytest-mypy` is well-structured, with standard files and legitimate dependencies.

This is a highly unusual and dangerous practice, often employed to evade detection or control the execution environment.\n4.  **Multi-Layered Encoding/Decoding:** The use of `base64.b64decode`, `zlib.decompress`, and `codecs.decode` in a nested fashion suggests an attempt to conceal the true payload.\n5.  **Randomness for Evasion:** The use of `random.randint` in the decoding logic can make the code's behavior unpredictable and harder to signature.\n\nThese characteristics are strong indicators of a malicious package designed to hide its true functionality.\n\n**Classification: Malicious**"", ""num_of_python_files"": 4, ""package_description"": ""NA"", ""available_python_files"": [""setup.py"", ""__main__.py"", ""utils.py"", ""__init__.py""], ""package_formatted_path"": "".temp/plain/2023-04-26-pymulticolor-v1.0.0_dump.json"", ""gemini_parsed_classification"": ""malicious"", ""gemini_parsed_suspicious_files"": [""setup.py""]}",,malicious,"The `setup.py` file contains highly suspicious code that indicates malicious intent, including code obfuscation, dynamic code execution, modification of built-in functions, multi-layered encoding/decoding, and randomness for evasion.",{setup.py},2025-06-30 11:59:03.336987+00,2025-06-30 11:59:03.336987+00,c85254c9-0ebe-4a89-932a-cfd780558ea6,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,faa9a3d7-ad12-46e3-9c0b-464f9a646c7b,8a178499-74d4-458a-a975-ec09a39a0159

It defines common metadata such as author, URL, description, and license (`Apache License 2.0`).\n*   **Legitimate Dependencies**: The `install_requires` section lists common and legitimate scientific computing and utility libraries like `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `autograd`, `dill`, and `alive-progress`. These are expected dependencies for a package focused on optimization.\n*   **Cython Integration**: The inclusion of Cython for compiling `.pyx` files is a common optimization technique in performance-critical Python libraries and is not indicative of malicious intent. The `setup.py` also gracefully handles compilation failures, falling back to a pure Python installation.\n*   **No Suspicious Imports/Activities**: The imported libraries in `setup.py` (`argparse`, `copy`, `distutils`, `os`, `sys`, `traceback`, `setuptools`, `numpy`, `Cython`, `pymoo`) are all standard for package management, system interaction, and scientific computing. There are no signs of unusual system calls, network communications, or obfuscated code that would suggest malicious behavior.\n*   **Empty Files**: While some of the requested files (`__init__.py`, `util.py`, `optimizer.py`, `algorithm.py`) were empty, this is not inherently malicious. For `__init__.py`, it simply marks a directory as a Python package, and for the others, their content might be dynamically generated or not essential for initial setup.

There is no suspicious code present.\n*   **`__init__.py`**: This file is also standard for package initialization, mainly importing the core functionality from `kaldi_io.py`. No suspicious code was found.\n*   **`kaldi_io.py`**: This is the main implementation file, and its functions are consistent with the package's described purpose: \""Glue code connecting Kaldi data and Python.\""\n    *   **Kaldi Integration**: The code extensively handles Kaldi-specific data formats (integer vectors, float vectors, matrices, posteriors, confusion networks) and I/O mechanisms (e.g., `.ark`, `.scp` files, and piping data).\n    *   **Environment Variables and Path Modification**: The script attempts to locate the `KALDI_ROOT` environment variable and modify the system's `PATH` to include Kaldi binaries. This is a common practice for libraries that interface with external tools like Kaldi, ensuring that necessary executables are accessible. While direct `PATH` modification can sometimes be a concern, in this context, it's for a legitimate purpose related to the package's functionality.\n    *   **Subprocess Execution**: The `popen` function uses `subprocess.Popen` to execute shell commands, primarily for handling Kaldi's I/O streams (e.g., reading from or writing to pipes connected to Kaldi utilities). This is expected behavior for a Kaldi-interfacing library. The commands executed through `popen` appear to be controlled and related to data processing, not arbitrary system commands. Error handling for subprocess failures is also implemented.\n    *   **Data Handling**: The functions for reading and writing various data types (`read_vec_int`, `write_vec_flt`, `read_mat`, etc.) primarily use `numpy` for numerical operations and `struct` for binary data manipulation, which are standard and efficient methods for scientific data processing in Python.\n    *   **No Malicious Indicators**: There are no signs of obfuscated code, attempts to connect to suspicious external servers, unauthorized file system access, or other common indicators of malicious activity.

It leverages Node.js to evaluate the challenge's JavaScript in a sandboxed context (`vm.runInNewContext`) to obtain the `jschl_answer` needed to bypass Cloudflare. While executing external commands via `subprocess` can be a vector for malicious activity if the code being executed is untrusted, in this specific context, the executed JavaScript originates from Cloudflare's challenge page, and the package's goal is to solve that challenge. The code also includes error handling for missing Node.js.\n    *   It handles redirects and sets necessary cookies (`cf_clearance`) to maintain the session after solving the challenge.\n*   **No Obvious Malicious Behavior:**\n    *   There is no evidence of file system manipulation beyond what's expected for package setup.\n    *   No suspicious network activity to unknown destinations.\n    *   No data exfiltration or other typical malicious payloads.\n    *   The code is generally readable and its logic aligns with its stated purpose.\n*   **`user_agents.py`:** Contains a list of common user-agent strings, which is standard for web scraping to mimic legitimate browser traffic.\n*   **Metadata Consistency:** The package's name, summary, and homepage (pointing to GitHub) are consistent with the code's functionality.\n\nIn conclusion, `cfscrape` is designed to automate interaction with websites protected by Cloudflare's anti-bot measures, a common task in web scraping.

The analysis focused on potential indicators of malicious behavior, including imported libraries, shell command execution, network activity, file system modifications, and code obfuscation.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n*   **Standard Build Practices:** The script primarily utilizes standard Python libraries for package building (`setuptools`, `distutils`, `os`, `sys`, `subprocess`, `shutil`).\n*   **Platform-Specific Adjustments:** It includes extensive conditional logic based on the operating system (`sys.platform`) and architecture to apply appropriate compiler and linker flags. This is a common practice for cross-platform C/C++ extension compilation to ensure compatibility and correct linking.\n*   **Linker Capability Check:** The `check_linker_need_libatomic()` function legitimately uses `subprocess.Popen` to determine if the linker requires `libatomic`, which is a valid build-time check.\n*   **Extension Module Compilation:** The script defines and builds a C++ extension module named `_protoc_compiler`, incorporating C/C++ source files and handling Cython integration if enabled. This is a core function of `grpcio-tools` for generating protobuf code.\n*   **Package Data Handling:** The `package_data()` function copies `.proto` files from source to the package's data directory, which is expected for a tool that depends on protobuf definitions.\n*   **Dependencies:** The `install_requires` section lists `protobuf`, `grpcio`, and `setuptools` as dependencies, all of which are legitimate and consistent with the package's purpose.\n*   **No Malicious Indicators:** There is no evidence of unusual network connections, arbitrary file system manipulation outside of the standard build and installation process, or obfuscated code designed to hide malicious intent.

The information provided (name, version, description, author, URL, license) is consistent with a legitimate utility library. There are no suspicious commands or dependencies.\n*   **`imagesize.py`:** This is the core file containing the package's functionality.\n    *   **Purpose:** The code is designed to extract image dimensions (width, height) and DPI information from various image file formats (GIF, PNG, JPEG, JPEG2000, TIFF, SVG, Netpbm, WebP). This aligns perfectly with the package's stated summary: \""Getting image size from png/jpeg/jpeg2000/gif file\"".\n    *   **Libraries Used:** It imports `io`, `os`, `re`, `struct`, and `xml.etree.ElementTree`. These are standard Python libraries and are appropriately used for file handling, regular expressions, binary data parsing, and XML parsing (for SVG), which are all legitimate operations for an image metadata tool.\n    *   **Functionality:** The `get()` and `getDPI()` functions read specific byte sequences and structures from the image file headers to determine dimensions and density, rather than performing full image decoding. This is an efficient and common method for this task.\n    *   **Security Concerns:** There are no indicators of malicious activity:\n        *   **No unauthorized network communication:** The code does not make any network requests.\n        *   **No file system manipulation (beyond reading):** The code only reads files (`'rb'`) and does not write, delete, or modify any files.\n        *   **No arbitrary code execution:** The code does not use `eval()`, `exec()`, or similar functions that could lead to arbitrary code execution.\n        *   **No data exfiltration:** There are no signs of collecting or sending sensitive user data.\n        *   **No obfuscation or suspicious patterns:** The code is clear, readable, and focused on its stated purpose.\n\nIn conclusion, the `imagesize` package is a legitimate utility for extracting image metadata, and its code demonstrates benign behavior."", ""num_of_python_files"": 6, ""package_description"": ""NA"", ""available_python_files"": [""setup.py"", ""test_getdpi.py"", ""test_get_filelike.py"", ""test_get.py"", ""__init__.py"", ""imagesize.py""], ""package_formatted_path"": "".temp/plain/imagesize-1.4.1_dump.json"", ""gemini_parsed_classification"": ""benign"", ""gemini_parsed_suspicious_files"": []}",,benign,"The `imagesize` package is a legitimate utility for extracting image metadata, and its code demonstrates benign behavior.

The included `README.md` and `requirements.txt` are standard for package metadata.\n*   **Clear Purpose:** The `description` and `keywords` in `setup()` clearly define the package's purpose as a statistical modeling library.\n\nBased on the metadata provided and the content of the `setup.py` file, the `linearmodels` package aligns with the behavior of a legitimate, well-structured scientific Python library."", ""num_of_python_files"": 64, ""package_description"": ""NA"", ""available_python_files"": [""test_firstdifference_ols.py"", ""test_base.py"", ""formula.py"", ""test_panel_covariance.py"", ""test_formula.py"", ""utility.py"", ""common.py"", ""test_cluster_input_formats.py"", ""parse_stata_results.py"", ""_utility.py"", ""exceptions.py"", ""test_pooled_ols.py"", ""execute-stata-simulated-data.py"", ""test_examples.py"", ""test_panel_ols.py"", ""test_equivalence.py"", ""parse_stata_3sls_results.py"", ""test_random_effects.py"", ""test_linear_factor_gmm.py"", ""test_postestimation.py"", ""conf.py"", ""test_simulated_against_stata.py"", ""test_3sls_against_stata.py"", ""read_stata_results.py"", ""execute-stata.py"", ""test_fama_macbeth.py"", ""test_results.py"", ""test_gmm.py"", ""test_absorbing.py"", ""absorbing.py"", ""statsmodels.py"", ""test_missing_data.py"", ""test_data.py"", ""test_formulas.py"", ""model.py"", ""results.py"", ""typed_getters.py"", ""test_datasets.py"", ""_version.py"", ""io.py"", ""test_covariance.py"", ""generate-panel-data.py"", ""test_tester.py"", ""base.py"", ""test_against_stata.py"", ""test_sur_against_stata.py"", ""__init__.py"", ""test_between_ols.py"", ""hypotheses.py"", ""data.py"", ""gmm.py"", ""test_sur.py"", ""test_model.py"", ""execute-stata-3sls.py"", ""covariance.py"", ""conftest.py"", ""test_3sls.py"", ""linalg.py"", ""setup.py"", ""generate_data.py"", ""test_typed_getters.py"", ""test_utility.py"", ""simulated-test-data.py"", ""test_linear_factor_model.py""], ""package_formatted_path"": "".temp/plain/linearmodels-4.27_dump.json"", ""gemini_parsed_classification"": ""benign"", ""gemini_parsed_suspicious_files"": []}",,benign,"The analysis of the `setup.py` file indicates that the `linearmodels` package uses standard libraries and practices, correctly handles Cython integration, includes expected package data, shows no malicious indicators, and has a clear purpose as a statistical modeling library.",{},2025-06-30 13:25:15.615975+00,2025-06-30 13:25:15.615975+00,c85254c9-0ebe-4a89-932a-cfd780558ea6,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,8a6f94f1-0b98-41df-9370-035c8820863f,8a178499-74d4-458a-a975-ec09a39a0159

Files like `v1_pod.py`, `v1_service.py`, `core_v1_api.py`, `apps_v1_api.py`, `kube_config.py`, `api_client.py`, and various API version files are exactly what you would expect to see in a Kubernetes API client.

formats), which aligns with the package's stated purpose.\n*   Crucially, the `package_behaviour` and `suspicious_malicious_files` fields are both empty, indicating that no suspicious activities or malicious files were detected during analysis.\n*   The `package_homepage` (`http://hachoir.readthedocs.io/`) points to a documentation hosting service, which is a common and legitimate practice for open-source projects.\n*   While `author_email` is \""NA\"", this alone is not a strong indicator of malice."", ""num_of_python_files"": 229, ""package_description"": ""NA"",

This is a standard practice for platform-specific packages.\n3.  **Dependency Management:** It ensures the presence of `pyobjc-core` header files, either by extracting them from an installed `pyobjc-core` egg or by locating them.\n4.  **Test Suite Execution:** It contains a custom `oc_test` command for running the package's test suite, including environment cleanup and path manipulation, which is common for testing setups.\n5.  **No Suspicious Activities:** The code does not exhibit any characteristics typically associated with malicious packages, such as:\n    *   Obfuscation or unusual encoding.\n    *   Unnecessary or suspicious network requests.\n    *   Unauthorized file system access or modification beyond standard installation paths.\n    *   Execution of arbitrary, non-build-related shell commands.\n    *   Collection or exfiltration of sensitive user data.\n    *   Use of obscure or unexpected libraries.\n6.  **Open Source Project:** The package details point to a legitimate open-source project on GitHub (`https://github.com/ronaldoussoren/pyobjc`).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the provided metadata and the analysis of the `pyobjc_setup.py` script, the `pyobjc-framework-SceneKit` package version 8.5 is **benign**.
