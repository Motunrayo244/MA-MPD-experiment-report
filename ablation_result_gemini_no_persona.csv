Specifically:\n\n1.  **Data Collection:** The `get_wan_ip` function attempts to retrieve the public IP address of the system. The `get_info` function collects sensitive system information including the hostname, current working directory, public IP, and local IP addresses.\n2.  **Data Exfiltration via DNS:** The collected information is then encoded and exfiltrated via DNS queries to the domain `u3y2rcq2ykwkohefvsie6wbaj1prdg.burpcollaborator.net`. Burp Collaborator is a known service used for out-of-band data exfiltration and callback monitoring, often by attackers.\n3.  **Command Hijacking:** The `setup.py` file modifies the `entry_points` to create a console script `pip3=pptest:mypip`. This means that when the `pip3` command is executed on the system, it will run the `mypip` function from this package, which initiates the data collection and exfiltration process. This is a clear attempt to hijack a legitimate system command for malicious purposes.\n4.  **Deceptive Messaging:** The `mypip` function prints a message, \""!!!Attention: it is just a security test.

This information is then exfiltrated via a POST request to a hardcoded external URL: `http://snowty.cn`. This is a clear attempt to send user and system data to an attacker-controlled server.\n2.  **File System Modification:** The script attempts to create a file named `biu.txt` in the `/tmp` directory using `os.system(\""touch /tmp/biu.txt\"")`. While `touch` itself isn't inherently malicious, the use of `os.system` and arbitrary file creation in a system directory without user consent is suspicious.\n3.  **Creation of Suspicious Files:** It constructs a filename in the system's temporary directory (`tempfile.gettempdir()`) with a `.php` extension, derived from an MD5 hash of the hostname. Although the current content written to this file is \""hello world\"", the structure of creating a `.php` file in a temporary location indicates preparation for potentially dropping malicious web shells or other executable content. The intention is to create a file that could be used for further exploitation.\n\nThese actions, especially the data exfiltration to an external server and unauthorized file system modifications, are strong indicators of a malicious package.\n\n**Suspicious files:** `setup.py`"", ""num_of_python_files"": 4, ""package_description"": ""{{ cookiecutter.package_name }}"", ""available_python_files"": [""setup.py"", ""test.py"", ""__init__.py"", ""test_{{cookiecutter.package_name}}.py""], ""package_formatted_path"": "".temp/plain/mybiubiubiu-0.1.1_dump.json"", ""gemini_parsed_classification"": ""malicious"", ""gemini_parsed_suspicious_files"": [""setup.py""]}","malicious","The `setup.py` file exhibits highly suspicious and malicious behavior, including data exfiltration of sensitive system information to an attacker-controlled server, unauthorized file system modifications, and the creation of a suspicious `.php` file in a temporary directory, indicating preparation for further exploitation.","{setup.py}","2025-06-30 17:26:14.734143+00","2025-06-30 17:26:14.734143+00","669f8a1e-bbca-4375-af79-45ae5acaf3e2","gemini/gemini-2.5-flash","5ec96071-b62a-4208-bef7-d74a106e11a4","294e38ab-fb2d-41ec-8bdf-3d23f9dade9b"
